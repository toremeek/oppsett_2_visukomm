          No… It's a thing; it's like a plan, but with more greatness. Did I
          mention we have comfy chairs? Aw, you're all Mr. Grumpy Face today.
          You've swallowed a planet! *Insistently* Bow ties are cool! Come on

          All I've got to do is pass as an ordinary human being. Simple. What
          could possibly go wrong? I'm the Doctor. Well, they call me the
          Doctor. I don't know why. I call me the Doctor too. I still don't know
          why.

          Aw, you're all Mr. Grumpy Face today. Father Christmas. Santa Claus.
          Or as I've always known him: Jeff. Annihilate? No. No violence. I
          won't stand for it. Not now, not ever, do you understand me?! I'm the
          Doctor, the Oncoming Storm - and you basically meant beat them in a
          football match, didn't you?

        It's art! A statement on modern society, 'Oh Ain't Modern Society
        Awful?'! I'm nobody's taxi service; I'm not gonna be there to catch you
        every time you feel like jumping out of a spaceship. You know how I
        sometimes have really brilliant ideas?
